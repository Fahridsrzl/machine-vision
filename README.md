Onion Performance Evaluation using Machine Vision

Description:

This repository contains a machine vision program for evaluating onion performance. The program can be used to calculate important performance parameters, such as:

Number of seedlings
Number of leaves
Leaf height
Leaf diameter
The program is designed to work automatically and can be used to monitor onion growth over time.

Technologies:

Python: The main programming language for the program.
OpenCV: A Python library for image processing and machine vision.
Raspberry Pi: A small computer used to run the program.
Requirements:

Raspberry Pi
Camera
Onions
Installation:

Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
Install OpenCV and other required Python libraries.
Run the program with the following command:
python main.py
Usage:

The program will automatically capture images of onions and calculate performance parameters. The results will be displayed in the console and saved to a log file.
